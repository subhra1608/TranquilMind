            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.

            What are anxiety disorders?

              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

            What are anxiety disorders?
              Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.

              What are the types of anxiety disorders?
              There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months.
              Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more.
              Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).
              What causes anxiety disorders?
              The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.

              Who is at risk for anxiety disorders?
              The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including:

              Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people
              Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood
              Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders
              Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia
              What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders?
              The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of:

              Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time.
              Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath
              Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do
              Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.
